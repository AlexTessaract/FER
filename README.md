# face_expression-_recognition
I collected a dataset(Face expression recognition dataset) from kaggle with 7 types of face expression . The dataset was divided into 2 folders , train and validation .Each folder of the dataset consists of 7 classes(sad,happy, angry, surprised,neutral,fear,disgust).The dataset was imbalanced as number of images in sad folder was 436 whereas the number of happy image was 7164. So  I took each folder and picked randomly 100 images and augmented them to make more of images and repeated this process.Thus I made more than 7000 images in each folder and train them on a 4 layer CNN model with maxpoling,batch normalizatio, dropout(25%)  and activation function as Relu in each layer.Then flatten and 1 Dense layer and 1 final output layer( activation function as softmax).Then trained the model with 100epochs on GPU(google colab) and saved the trained model in a pickle file. Then with HTML5 and CSS and Javascript made a front end to capture an image from the user. Then in a flask file in backend is used to resize the input image with size(48,48) and make it  grayscale and fit on the pickle file to pedict the face expression of the user and show the output (expression ) to the user.
